# Symphony Elixir

This directory contains the current Elixir/OTP implementation of Symphony, based on
[`SPEC.md`](../SPEC.md) at the repository root.

> [!WARNING]
> Symphony Elixir is prototype software intended for evaluation only and is presented as-is.
> We recommend implementing your own hardened version based on `SPEC.md`.

## How it works

1. Polls Linear for candidate work
2. Creates an isolated workspace per issue
3. Launches Claude Code as a CLI subprocess inside the workspace
4. Sends a workflow prompt to Claude Code
5. Keeps Claude Code working on the issue until the work is done

During Claude Code sessions, Symphony also serves a client-side `linear_graphql` tool so that repo
skills can make raw Linear GraphQL calls.

If a claimed issue moves to a terminal state (`Done`, `Closed`, `Cancelled`, or `Duplicate`),
Symphony stops the active agent for that issue and cleans up matching workspaces.

## How to use it

1. Make sure your codebase is set up to work well with agents.
2. Get a new personal token in Linear via Settings → Security & access → Personal API keys, and
   set it as the `LINEAR_API_KEY` environment variable.
3. Copy this directory's `WORKFLOW.md` to your repo.
4. Optionally copy the `commit`, `push`, `pull`, `land`, and `linear` skills to your repo.
   - The `linear` skill expects Symphony's `linear_graphql` tool for raw Linear GraphQL
     operations such as comment editing or upload flows.
5. Customize the copied `WORKFLOW.md` file for your project.
   - To get your project's slug, right-click the project and copy its URL. The slug is part of the
     URL.
   - When creating a workflow based on this repo, note that it depends on non-standard Linear
     issue statuses: "Rework", "Human Review", and "Merging". You can customize them in
     Team Settings → Workflow in Linear.
6. Follow the instructions below to install the required runtime dependencies and start the service.

## Prerequisites

We recommend using [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) to manage Elixir/Erlang versions.

```bash
mise install
mise exec -- elixir --version
```

## Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/openai/symphony
cd symphony/elixir
mise trust
mise install
mise exec -- mix setup
mise exec -- mix build
mise exec -- ./bin/symphony ./WORKFLOW.md
```

## Configuration

Pass a custom workflow file path to `./bin/symphony` when starting the service:

```bash
./bin/symphony /path/to/custom/WORKFLOW.md
```

If no path is passed, Symphony defaults to `./WORKFLOW.md`.

Optional flags:

- `--logs-root` tells Symphony to write logs under a different directory (default: `./log`)
- `--port` also starts the HTTP observability service (default: disabled)

The `WORKFLOW.md` file uses YAML front matter for configuration, plus a Markdown body used as the
Claude Code session prompt.

Minimal example:

```md
---
tracker:
  kind: linear
  project_slug: "..."
workspace:
  root: ~/code/workspaces
hooks:
  after_create: |
    git clone git@github.com:your-org/your-repo.git .
agent:
  max_concurrent_agents: 10
  max_turns: 20
claude:
  command: claude
  permission_mode: default
  dangerously_skip_permissions: true
  max_turns: 50
  output_format: stream-json
---

You are working on a Linear issue {{ issue.identifier }}.

Title: {{ issue.title }} Body: {{ issue.description }}
```

Notes:

- If a value is missing, defaults are used.
- `claude.permission_mode` controls Claude Code's permission system. Supported values: `default`,
  `plan`, `bypassPermissions`. Default: `default`.
- `claude.dangerously_skip_permissions` when `true`, passes `--dangerously-skip-permissions` to
  Claude Code, bypassing all permission checks. Recommended for unattended operation when combined
  with `claude.allowed_tools` for tightening. Default: `true`.
- `claude.max_turns` caps how many back-to-back turns Claude Code will run per invocation.
  Default: `50`.
- `claude.output_format` controls output parsing. Must be `stream-json` for Symphony to parse
  usage events. Default: `stream-json`.
- `claude.model` optionally overrides the Claude model used. When unset, Claude Code uses its default.
- `claude.allowed_tools` optionally restricts which tools Claude Code may use (list of tool names).
- `claude.turn_timeout_ms` maximum wall-clock time per turn in milliseconds.
- `claude.stall_timeout_ms` maximum time without output before a turn is considered stalled.
- `agent.max_turns` caps how many back-to-back Claude Code turns Symphony will run in a single agent
  invocation when a turn completes normally but the issue is still in an active state. Default: `20`.
- If the Markdown body is blank, Symphony uses a default prompt template that includes the issue
  identifier, title, and body.
- Use `hooks.after_create` to bootstrap a fresh workspace. For a Git-backed repo, you can run
  `git clone ... .` there, along with any other setup commands you need.
- If a hook needs `mise exec` inside a freshly cloned workspace, trust the repo config and fetch
  the project dependencies in `hooks.after_create` before invoking `mise` later from other hooks.
- `tracker.api_key` reads from `LINEAR_API_KEY` when unset or when value is `$LINEAR_API_KEY`.
- For path values, `~` is expanded to the home directory.
- For env-backed path values, use `$VAR`. `workspace.root` resolves `$VAR` before path handling,
  while `claude.command` stays a shell command string and any `$VAR` expansion there happens in the
  launched shell.

```yaml
tracker:
  api_key: $LINEAR_API_KEY
workspace:
  root: $SYMPHONY_WORKSPACE_ROOT
hooks:
  after_create: |
    git clone --depth 1 "$SOURCE_REPO_URL" .
claude:
  command: "$CLAUDE_BIN"
  model: "claude-opus-4-6"
  dangerously_skip_permissions: true
```

- If `WORKFLOW.md` is missing or has invalid YAML, startup and scheduling are halted until fixed.
- `server.port` or CLI `--port` enables the optional HTTP dashboard and JSON API at `/`,
  `/api/v1/state`, `/api/v1/<issue_identifier>`, and `/api/v1/refresh`.

## Project Layout

- `lib/`: application code and Mix tasks
- `test/`: ExUnit coverage for runtime behavior
- `WORKFLOW.md`: in-repo workflow contract used by local runs
- `../.claude/`: repository-local Claude Code configuration and setup helpers

## Testing

```bash
make all
```

## FAQ

### Why Elixir?

Elixir is built on Erlang/BEAM/OTP, which is great for supervising long-running processes. It has an
active ecosystem of tools and libraries. It also supports hot code reloading without stopping
actively running subagents, which is very useful during development.

### What's the easiest way to set this up for my own codebase?

Launch `claude` in your repo, give it the URL to the Symphony repo, and ask it to set things up for
you.
